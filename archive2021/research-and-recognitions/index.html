        <h1>Public Engagement and Engaged Research</h1>
        <p class="byline"></p>
        <p>College of Education leadership worked with campus leaders to revise the tenure process to facilitate and recognize faculty public engagement. Education faculty are leaders in this realm with engaged research activity that fulfills our mission of research, teaching and service. A few examples of faculty recognized for their public engagement and engaged research include:</p>
<ul class="imagelist"><li><a href="https://education.illinois.edu/faculty/sdymond"><img class="simple" src="/archive2021/img/research-recognition/stacy-dymond.png" alt="Stacy Dymond"></a><p><a href="https://education.illinois.edu/faculty/sdymond"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stacy Dymond</span></a>, professor in Special Education and David Strauser (Community Health) established the Illinois Center on Transition and Work. The Center offers state-wide training and technical assistance to school personnel, rehabilitation counselors, and families to improve post-school employment outcomes for students with significant disabilities. Funded by the Illinois State Board of Education, this 5-year, $5 million-dollar project is a collaboration between the College of Education and the College of Applied Heath Sciences. Dymond, Strauser, and John Kosciulek (Community Health) were also awarded a Vocational Training Grant. This 5-year, $1.5 million-dollar project funded by the Illinois Department of Human Services and Division of Vocational Rehabilitation will provide statewide training to vocational rehabilitation counselors who prepare individuals with disabilities for employment.</p></li><li><a href="https://education.illinois.edu/faculty/meghanbm"><img class="simple" src="/archive2021/img/research-recognition/meghan-burke.png" alt="Meghan Burke"></a><p><a href="https://education.illinois.edu/faculty/meghanbm"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Meghan Burke</span></a>, professor in Special Education, is the faculty mentor for the Community-Academic Scholars project “Addressing Social Inequity in Early Intervention Services for Young Children with Disabilities.” In Illinois, over 20,000 young (aged 0-3) children with delays and/or disabilities receive early intervention services (e.g., speech therapy, physical therapy). These services are critical to their development and long-term functioning. Prior to COVID-19, early intervention (EI) services were provided in person. With COVID-19, Illinois pivoted to offer EI services via telehealth. However, this introduced inequity as families without access to technology and/or consistent internet could not access EI via telehealth. To address this inequity, the Early Intervention Clearinghouse (which is housed at University of Illinois Urbana- Champaign) received a grant to provide technology and data plans to families of young children with delays/disabilities so they can access EI. The Community-Academic Scholars works with the Clearinghouse, Family Matters, and Dr. Burke to conduct qualitative and quantitative research about the technology loan program to determine if the program closes inequities.</p></li><li><a href="https://education.illinois.edu/faculty/ezamanig"><img class="simple" src="/archive2021/img/research-recognition/eboni-zamani-gallaher.png" alt="Eboni Zamani-Gallaher"></a><p><a href="https://education.illinois.edu/faculty/ezamanig"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eboni Zamani-Gallaher</span></a>, professor in Education Policy, Organization & Leadership and director of the Office of Community College Research and Leadership is building out networks for shaping the community college landscape nationwide to more widely disseminate best practices, especially those that enhance equitable access to higher education for underserved students, changing the higher education landscape across the US. OCCRL has received funding from the National Science Foundation, The Council for the Study of Community Colleges, Lumina Foundation, and Gates Foundation.</p></li><li><a href="https://education.illinois.edu/faculty/nrgracia"><img class="simple double" src="/archive2021/img/research-recognition/nidia-ruedas-gracia.png" alt="Nidia Ruedas-Gracia"></a><p><a href="https://education.illinois.edu/faculty/nrgracia"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nidia Ruedas-Gracia</span></a>, assistant professor in Educational Psychology leads the Racial Ethnic Cultural Belonging and Belonging Vigilance study. This project seeks to provide a scholarly understanding of Racial Ethnic Cultural (REC) Belonging and Belonging Vigilance. Using focus group, interview, and survey data, Ruedas-Garcia hopes to develop a theoretical framework and testable measure that can be valid and reliable among diverse REC groups. Collaborators: Helen Neville, professor in Educational Psychology, Andi Lee, and Amir Maghsoodi.</p></li><li><a href="https://education.illinois.edu/faculty/cmn"><img class="simple" src="/archive2021/img/research-recognition/chris-napolitano.png" alt="Chris Napolitano"></a><p><a href="https://education.illinois.edu/faculty/cmn"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Chris Napolitano</span></a>, assistant professor in Educational Psychology and recent Spitze-Mather Award winner, has strengthened his collaboration with the World Bank. Their collaboration investigates effective interventions to promote thriving among young people around the globe. Overall, their collaborative work explores how the beliefs and skills of youth can be harnessed promote their well-being. Specifically, one project examines whether youth aspirations and expectations for their future predict academic performance and employment outcomes among Basotho, Indonesian, Moldovan, Macedonian, Sudanese, Turkish Cypriot, UK and US youth. Their results will direct future large-scale interventions facilitated by the World Bank.</p></li><li><a href="https://education.illinois.edu/faculty/janders"><img class="simple" src="/archive2021/img/research-recognition/james-anderson.png" alt="James Anderson"></a><p><a href="https://education.illinois.edu/faculty/janders"><span style="font-weight: bold;">James Anderson</span></a>, dean of the College of Education, was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, one of the oldest honor societies in the nation. He was sworn into the Board of Trustees at Stillman College in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and inducted into the Stillman College Educator Hall of Fame—both in 2020. He is recognized as a groundbreaking scholar on the history of U.S. and African American education and achievement. His seminal book, “The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860-1935,” won the American Educational Research Association’s outstanding book award in 1990. He also received the AERA’s highest honor, a Presidential Citation, in 2020. A member of the National Academy of Education and the former senior editor of the journal History of Education Quarterly, Anderson served as an expert witness in a series of federal desegregation and affirmative action cases.

The game, called energIze uses the Microsoft Kinect to empower children to act out different forms of energy, energy transfer, and to reason about conservation of energy. Lindgren and Mike Tissenbaum, assistant professor, Educational Psychology, are currently working with the Lawrence Hall of Science in Berkeley, CA, where the energIze exhibit is currently active on the museum floor, to develop a system of connected embodied learning exhibits that build off of each other and facilitate learning transfer.</p></li><li><a href="https://education.illinois.edu/faculty/kern4"><img class="simple" src="/archive2021/img/research-recognition/justin-kern.png" alt="Justin Kern"></a><p><a href="https://education.illinois.edu/faculty/kern4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Justin Kern</span></a>, assistant professor, Quantitative and Evaluative Research Methodologies, received the Outstanding Reviewer Award for the Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics and was named a Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Faculty Mentor Fellow in Educational Measurement.
