<p class="large">Our mission extends beyond our classrooms and campus. We make a difference in people’s lives locally, nationally, and globally through invigorating outreach informed by our commitment to community and rigorous research culture</p>
<p>Quickly pivoting to a virtual conference due to COVID-19, the Illinois New Teacher Collaborative (INTC) lived out its theme of resilience and compassion, shifting gears quickly to transform to a remote conference just six weeks before the conference was to be held, and offering it free this year, knowing that many districts had frozen requests for professional learning funds. As a result, the conference had more registrants than ever, as 300-plus new and preservice teachers signed up to take advantage of the free offerings.</p>
<p class="blockquote clear"><strong>&quot;We want people to share what they’ve learned, to give them platforms to have that network with the hopes that it goes beyond what we provide. It’s an avenue for continued professional and personal growth for these new teachers.&quot;</strong></p>
