Since 1966, Chicago Public Schools had a visible police presence in its schools. In February the school board voted to no longer have Chicago Police serve as school resource officers (SROs). That decision can now be considered in light of findings from a study conducted by **Rebecca Hinze-Pifer**, an assistant professor in Education Policy, Organization & Leadership who partnered with researchers at the **University of Chicago Consortium on School Research** and the Center for Childhood Resilience at Lurie Children’s Hospital.

We looked at what happened when Chicago Public Schools began removing SROs in the 2020-21 school year,” says Rebecca Hinze-Pifer, “and found no evidence of detrimental consequences.”{.quote}
