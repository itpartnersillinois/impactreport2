<p><strong>Leading Individuals and Families to Transformation (LIFT) Champaign</strong> is a new collaboration of the Champaign Unit 4 School District, City of Champaign, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Chancellor’s Office of Public Engagement, and the <strong>Center for Culturally Responsive Evaluation and Assessment (CREA)</strong> aimed at provided targeted, culturally responsive, holistic, and trauma-informed care for  Black students and their families.</p>
<p>LIFT focuses on African American youth in grades K-12, as well as their families, who are experiencing significant challenges academically and personally. Through intensive wraparound support and connections to both school-based and community resources, LIFT is designed to ensure students and families can succeed and thrive through severe circumstances in their scholastic or personal lives.</p>
<p>For more about how the College of Education’s Center for Culturally Responsive Evaluation and Assessment is partnered with LIFT Champaign we spoke with <strong>Rodney Hopson</strong>, professor of Educational Psychology, who is serving as principal investigator for evaluation of the program’s impact.</p>
<p><strong>Can you explain how CREA became involved with this community project, and in what capacities?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hopson</strong>: Dr. Wanda Ward in the campus’ Office of Public Engagement reached out to CREA requesting our involvement. With Chancellor’s Office support, we were able to hire a lead evaluator, Dr. Anthony Sullers, Jr. who is our point of contact with LIFT partners. I serve as PI on the project, and Cecilia Vaughn-Guy is our graduate student research assistant evaluator.</p>
<p>CREA is the external evaluator on the project. We are responsible for a rigorous evaluation process to help determine the quality and effectiveness of the LIFT Champaign program in reaching its goals: i)  to identify program weaknesses/limitations, ii) to provide suggestions for program improvements, and iii) to ensure sustainability and institutionalization of the program as an innovative model in the support of participating African American youths and their families.</p>
<p><strong>What do you find most unique, interesting, or essential about the program’s potential to affect transformation for students and their families?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hopson</strong>: The promise of the wraparound services being proposed and implemented by the Unit 4 School District and City of Champaign and is laudable and likely one of the most innovative reform efforts in the region. Working with dedicated and committed city and school district staff is amazing, and their ability to collaborate with proven leaders in the area on this common issue is commendable.</p>
<p><strong>Why is CREA’s work with the LIFT Champaign program important?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hopson</strong>: CREA is an international community of scholars/practitioners that exists to promote a culturally responsive stance in all forms of systematic inquiry including evaluation, assessment, policy analysis, applied research, and action research. Our work is applied at leading institutions and organizations around the world, through and with our affiliates, and via our deep and sustained partnerships. More significantly, CREA’s work tends not to be focused directly in the city or region and this project allows us to use our skillsets for important issues facing the livelihood and schooling futures of local students. I think CREA researchers are well-suited for this project based on existing and developing relationships with the Unit 4 school district and City, and this allows us to be more intentional in our work locally to build and support families and systems in need.</p>
