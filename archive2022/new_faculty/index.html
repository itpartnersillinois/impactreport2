She studies how early elementary school students form relationships with mathematics,. Her research highlights the importance of making space in math classrooms for students to exercise agency. Altshuler recently completed her Ph.D. in Learning Sciences at Northwestern University in Evanston, where she worked with in-service and pre-service elementary school teachers to explore students’ complex mathematical ideas. &quot;},{&quot;image&quot;:&quot;/img/new_faculty/lorenzo_baber.png&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;ldbaber&quot;,&quot;header&quot;:&quot;Lorenzo Baber&quot;,&quot;subheader&quot;:&quot;Professor, Education Policy, Organization &amp; Leadership&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Lorenzo Baber returns to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign after serving as a tenured faculty member at Loyola University Chicago and Iowa State University.
