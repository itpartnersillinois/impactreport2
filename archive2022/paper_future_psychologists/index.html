        <h1>Train Future Psychologists to Dismantle Racism, Injustice in Society</h1>

<p>A team of psychologists, led by scholars at the College of Education, proposes a new training model that would prepare all practitioners in their discipline to respond to the social ills of racial discrimination and other forms of repression. The team includes, pictured from left, predoctoral candidate B. Andi Lee, educational psychology professor Helen Neville and doctoral intern Nimot Ogunfemi.</p>
<p>Comprised of scholars representing several universities,the team has created an anti-racist training model for psychologists that will prepare them to dismantle racism in society, as opposed to only teaching coping skills to individuals. The team is also calling upon the psychology discipline to acknowledge the racist theories and practices in its history and the inequities they created.</p>
<p>While the training, called the Public Psychology for Liberation model, was designed for public psychologists – those who work in public settings – the team says it would have universal benefit for everyone in their discipline, regardless of field.</p>
<p>In a recently published paper, the team outlined the new training paradigm, saying that it challenges the “anti-Blackness, racial oppression and myths of white supremacy” embedded in society and “built uncritically into our training and discipline.”</p>
<p>“We want to transform with whom, what and how we teach, research and write by centering on the people most marginalized in society and the experiences and topics that they want to research,” said Helen A. Neville, a professor of Educational Psychology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the first author of the paper.</p>
<p>The model also represents a commitment to provide mental health services in the public sector to, by and with some of the society’s most oppressed people. Grounded in the principles of liberation psychology – which emphasize collective well-being, consciousness of social injustices and resistance to the normalization of discrimination and oppression – the PPL model has the potential to transform community members’ lives, the team said.</p>
