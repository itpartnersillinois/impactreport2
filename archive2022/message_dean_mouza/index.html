<p>I am deeply honored to join the College of Education at Illinois and grateful to my predecessor, Dr. James D. Anderson, for his leadership and the indelible mark he has made on this College, university, and the field of education.</p>
<p>Educators are at the leading edge of society. We engage daily with the needs of learners and experience their joys and struggles, lived out in classrooms and communities around the world. This is why we engage our pre-service teachers with coursework like Identity and Difference in Education (EDUC 201). And why our faculty launched a wide-range of innovative initiatives in 2022, including: programs that teach media literacy skills to high school students; online professional development series that prepare teachers and librarians in learning and teaching about Asian American history; and professional learnings programs on leading inclusive, inquiry-based social studies instruction for K-12 students.</p>
<p>Responsiveness to the needs of learners and their communities is a hallmark of our College. Education at Illinois has a rich history of public engagement with local, regional, national, and global communities. We continue to build on this history with impactful efforts like the Champaign Freedom School and our I-Global program which connects middle school students with international peers and culture, virtually.</p>
<p>My primary goal as dean is to support our education community in the pursuit of excellence. As you read through this 2022 Impact Report, you’ll see why I am proud to be a part of this College—every page, another example of excellence in action by our faculty, students, staff, and alumni.</p>
<p>Yours in Orange &amp; Blue,</p>
<p><strong>Chrystalla Mouza</strong></p>
<p>Dean, College of Education</p>
