<p>Graduate students at Illinois are part of a community of scholars who infuse learning and teaching with research and practice. Our faculty, who are leaders in the field, prepare master’s and doctoral students to deal with the most challenging issues in education.</p>
<h2>Doctoral Student Launches First Online Non-Profit Networking Platform in Egypt</h2>
<p>Mostafa Adel Hanafy, originally from Egypt, is a second year Ph.D. student in the Department of Education Policy, Organization and Leadership’s Learning Design and Leadership (LDL) program. He holds two master’s degrees: an M.A. in Public Administration from the American University in Cairo, Egypt, and an MSc in Project Management, from Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, Scotland, which he earned in 2016.</p>
<p>In addition to his academic achievements, Mostafa has more than a decade of experience working with leading international organizations including Save the Children, GIZ, United Nations Volunteers, UNICEF, and more. Combining his pursuit of accessible learning opportunities for all with his experience working in non-profits, Mostafa recently led the development and launch of a website called NGOs’ Hub that is serving thousands of users and highlights non-profit sector opportunities based in Egypt.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the non-profit sector in Egypt is very big, there wasn’t a singular Egyptian website or tool that gathered and organized all opportunities (internships, jobs, scholarships) in one place.</p>
<p>Hanafy changed that.</p>
<p>“NGOs’ Hub began about 12 years ago as a Facebook Group. It originally started with the aim of providing a space for development professionals or those who aspire to join the non-profit field to post job openings, internships, or scholarships. The group has been evolving from that to the first online community of practice for the non-profit field in Egypt.”</p>
<p>NGOs’ Hub is now a fully-operational website—launched in the summer of 2022—along with a complementary and active Facebook Group of more than 107,000 members and counting.</p>
