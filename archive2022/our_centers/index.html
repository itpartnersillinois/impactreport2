<p>The College’s <strong>Engaged at Illinois Speaker Series</strong> kicked off in October 2022 featuring the <strong>Education Justice Project (EJP)</strong>.</p>
<p>EJP director Rebecca Ginsburg shared the work being done with a video release and panel discussion. EJP is a vibrant community of incarcerated students, educators, formerly incarcerated individuals, and others who are committed to a more just and humane world.</p>
<h2><span class="orange">Freedom School:</span> Bigger, Better, and Brighter Future</h2>
<p><img src="/img/centers/jon_hale.png" alt="Jon Hale">{ .circle .top-right }</p>
<p>Freedom School in Champaign completed its second year of programming and exciting growth is on the horizon—particularly if the school is chosen as one of the 45 programs across the state to receive part of a $17M grant from the Illinois State Board of Education. The grant would create the nation’s first state-funded <strong>Freedom Schools network</strong>. The University of Illinois’ involvement with Freedom School was initiated by <strong>Jon Hale</strong> associate professor in Education Policy, Organization &amp; Leadership and Curriculum &amp; Instruction in the College of Education. Hale has worked with Dr. Kristal Clemons, the national director of CDF Freedom Schools, for more than a decade. “We’re nationally partnered with one of the strongest children’s rights advocacy groups in the country,” Hale says. “The university is providing critical support to a community program. We partner with committed, community-based advocates with the expertise, knowledge, willpower, and networks to run Freedom School successfully, but the university is providing resources in a way that’s never been done before. And that’s exciting.”</p>
