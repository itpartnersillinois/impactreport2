        <h1>I-Global is Growing</h1>
        <p class="byline"></p>
        <p><img src="/img/iglobal.png" alt="Four middle school students smiling outside in front of a school">{ .top .full }</p>
<ul class="stats no-bullets">
<li><span class="blue">1,300</span> Middle school student participants</li>
<li><span>17</span> Participating countries</li>
<li><span class="blue">55</span> Undergraduate pre-service teachers</li>
<li><span>101</span> International students</li>
</ul>
<p>I-Global was created to help middle schoolers from around the world connect with each other and learn what it means to live in a global society. { .large }</p>
<p>I-Global launched in 2021 with a curriculum based on the <strong>Sustainable Development Goals</strong> developed by the United Nations.</p>
<p>The 17 goals cover issues such as No Poverty, Zero Hunger, Quality Education, and Clean Water and Sanitation.</p>
<h2>New Features in 2022</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Creating a far greater international mix of students.</strong> Now, instead of primarily being in a group of kids from their own country and occasionally mixing with others, participants are placed in a group of students who collectively hail from multiple countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moving away from school-based students</strong> to home-schooled children and 4-H clubs. Most U.S. kids have been inundated with online learning, and teachers are stretched to the limit. The hope is that will change in the near future and schools will once again be a prime source for program participants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Changing to a quarter system</strong> to manage the effect daylight savings creates. Now, the program has four eight-week sessions, with breaks at the two time changes and at the end of the calendar year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Undergraduate students are in charge.</strong> Last year, grad students ran the show, and they are still very much involved. Beyond giving middle schoolers the international experience and the opportunity to learn from each, the program is also geared to expose preservice teachers to online teaching and to teaching different types of students from around the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Undergraduates now earn internship credit</strong> in addition to being paid for their time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Overcoming Language Barriers</h2>
<p>If you’re wondering how language barriers are crossed, says Janine Solberg, I-Global assistant director and doctoral student in the College’s Department of Education Policy, Organization and Leadership, the University of Illinois is the perfect resource for such a challenge. “We have so many international students here,” she says.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a group of students in I-Global from Italy, and they were struggling with the language, so we found a couple of seniors on campus who are majoring in Italian and they came to the sessions and provided the necessary translation.&quot; Similar solutions have been found through students on campus who speak Mandarin, Bengali, Hindi, Kazakh, and numerous other languages.</p>
