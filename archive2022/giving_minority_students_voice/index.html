        <h1>Giving Minoritized Students a Voice</h1>
        <p class="byline"></p>

<p>In conducting youth-led participatory action research, <strong>Rachel Roegman</strong> is giving a voice to minoritized high school youths who rarely are heard.</p>
<p>Roegman, an associate professor in Education Policy, Organization and Leadership, has been working the past two years with students from two high schools, one in Indiana and one in Illinois, on issues impacting transgender and gender nonconforming youth.</p>
<p>“We’re working on how to make schools more inclusive places for them,” Roegman says. “What kinds of systems do we need for all youth to feel safe and supported?”</p>
<p>Roegman went in with the idea of talking with school administrators about the types of changes that would make transgender and gender nonconforming youth safe, but the students she met with wanted to directly address their high school peers.</p>
<p>Roegman practiced what she was preaching. She listened to the students. She gave them the voice they were yearning to use. She empowered them to take control of their environment.</p>
<p>“I’m giving them the opportunity to give direction to the research, with guidance,” she says.“What I think is important isn’t always what they think is important. I’m honoring what they bring and where they want the research to go.”</p>
<h2>Launching Surveys, Presenting at Conferences</h2>
<p>“It’s a little more challenging to educate their peers as opposed to their administrators,” Roegman says. “What do you do if you see someone in the bathroom and don’t think they’re the right gender? The answer is you don’t do anything. You just trust that they’re in the right place. But creating a culture where that can happen is a challenge.”</p>
<p>It’s a challenge that the Illinois group is taking head-on. Roegman began meeting with this group in January 2022. “We’re about to launch a survey to get a better understanding of students’ and teachers’ beliefs of what it means to be transgender,” she says. “It’s a GLSEN survey [formerly the Gay, Lesbian &amp; Straight Education Network], a national school climate survey that we’ve modified. Once we get the results, we’ll share the data with the school next year in an assembly, and then we’ll go to some leadership conferences around the state and some LGBTQ conferences.”</p>
<p>The Indiana group, which began meeting in January 2021, created a video in which they shared some of their experiences. “They also presented at a teachers’ conference, and now the students are working on policy changes they would like to see and will share that with the school board,” Roegman notes.</p>
<h2>Expanding the Vision</h2>
<p>Another way Roegman gave the Indiana group more voice was in expanding the original research idea. “When we went in, we were really focused on gender and gender nonconforming students, but they are thinking more inclusively about all minoritized groups,” she explains. That includes the large Latinx population in the school, many of whom have names that their teachers Americanize.</p>
<p>The Indiana students are also expanding the focus to include transgender students of color, understanding that their experiences are different from those of white transgender students.</p>
<h2>Funded by Two Grants</h2>
<p>Roegman’s research is funded by two separate grants, one from the Illinois Campus Research Board and the other from the Spencer Foundation.</p>
