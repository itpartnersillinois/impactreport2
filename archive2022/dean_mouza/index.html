<p>Introducing Dean Mouza { .large }</p>
<p><strong>Chrystalla Mouza’s</strong> parents had to permanently abandon their education while they were in elementary school to help out in their respective homes and in the fields. Her two older sisters never had the opportunity to go to college.</p>
<p>In 1974, during a period of political unrest, Mouza and her family were forced to flee their home on the tiny Mediterranean island of Cyprus and become refugees. College appeared to be an unlikely destination in her life, as well. They landed on their feet in a new town and started a new life. Mouza’s father worked various jobs in the Middle East to support his family, while her mother cared for the three girls at home. Both her parents have since passed away, but their resilience and work ethic reside firmly within her.</p>
<p>Chrystalla Mouza was the first person in her family to attend college. She went where neither her parents nor her sisters could go. She was determined to make the most of it.</p>
<p>Here, Mouza shares her passion for education, her career before coming to the University of Illinois, and her vision for the College of Education.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you choose to go into education?</strong></p>
<p>I chose to pursue a degree in education for two reasons: there was a teacher shortage in my home country, and I saw teaching as an opportunity to contribute back to society. I was admitted to the University of Ioannina in Greece, where I received an undergraduate degree in elementary education.</p>
<p><strong>Describe your passion for education and how it has evolved over the years.</strong></p>
<p>Upon graduation from college, I taught elementary school for two years in Cyprus. In my first year, I taught in a city school, not far from where I went to school myself. On my first day, I was greeted by my former fifth grade teacher who had already been at the school for several years. Unbeknownst to me, she brought with her one of my old notebooks she had kept over the years. That incident truly demonstrated the lifelong bond between students and educators and the vital role teachers play in the development of their students. We both taught fifth grade that year and she was an inspiring mentor to me, further fueling my passion to become the most effective teacher I could be.</p>
<p><strong>During your time at the University of Delaware you were also a professor of computer and information sciences. Please tell us about your research interests and how they have evolved throughout your career.</strong></p>
<p>For the past 25 years, my research has explored how educators learn to integrate emerging technologies—for example, software, apps, coding tools, robots, virtual reality—with content and pedagogy to support student learning, and how technology-rich learning environments support teacher and student outcomes. I have explored these issues in real-world formal and informal settings including schools, university classrooms, libraries, and after-school programs.</p>
<p>“Throughout my career, I have remained steadfast and passionate about expanding education opportunities to diverse groups and supporting a higher education system that promotes equity and social mobility. Educational technology remains a precious cornerstone of such equitable educational system.”{ .blockquote }</p>
<p><strong>What attracted you to the University of Illinois? Why did the position of dean of the College of Education appeal to you?</strong></p>
<p>I was attracted to the University of Illinois because of the strong alignment between the College’s vision and my own vision for leadership and excellence. Specifically, there were three primary reasons I was attracted to Illinois: the opportunity to further strengthen research and elevate the prominence and visibility of an already outstanding college, the commitment to the mission of land-grant universities and their role in improving the lives of people and communities locally and globally, and the strong commitment of both the College and the university to diversity, equity, and community engagement—issues that have been at the cornerstone of my work for the last two decades.</p>
<p><strong>What opportunities here excite you?</strong></p>
<p>The College of Education at the University of Illinois has always been a leader among colleges of education and boasts an outstanding faculty and student body. I was excited about the opportunity to work and learn with this outstanding group of colleagues who are committed to preparing the next generation of educators, scholars, and leaders. I was also very excited about the College and campus’ strong tradition of interdisciplinary research. I truly believe that to solve complex societal problems we need to bring together expertise from different functional areas. The boundaries between disciplines are becoming less rigid with the focus being on skills and the ability to communicate and collaborate with multiple constituencies across fields. The University of Illinois is at the foref ront of such efforts and the College of Education is already well positioned to further support these endeavors, boasting many interdisciplinary collaborations with computer science, engineering, media, and the state-wide Discovery Partners Institute, to name a few. I am also excited about enhancing collaborations with the Carle Illinois College of Medicine and the Research Park as we look for ways to support innovation and entrepreneurship across the university. The Bureau of Educational Research has already been laying the foundation for this work.</p>
<p><strong>What do you see as primary challenges facing the College? What are your initial thoughts about how to address them?</strong></p>
<p>Although not unique to the College of Education, there are many nationwide challenges facing higher education today. These include declining enrollments, the rising cost of higher education, lack of diversity, and our ability to impact practice through scholarship. Conf ronting these challenges can generate new opportunities that will help the College generate improvements and innovative approaches on how we operate. As a public research university, I believe we are in a unique position to turn obstacles into opportunities and craft a new vision that is centered on innovation, equity, engagement, and research excellence.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any previous connections to the university or the College?</strong></p>
<p>While I have had the opportunity to interact with many of the faculty during education conferences and am familiar with their work, I had no prior direct connection to the University of Illinois. However, my husband is a graduate of the university, having received his Ph.D. in Business Administration from the Gies College of Business. I therefore knew a lot about the university just by listening to his own experiences as a graduate student over the last 25 years we have been together. Our family has been avid supporters of Fighting Illini athletics and can’t wait to cheer for them in person now.</p>
<p><strong>What do you hope to accomplish as the new leader of the College of Education?</strong></p>
<p>While I have ambitions and goals about the future of our College, I believe it is essential to work with faculty, staff, students, and our alumni to develop and nurture a common vision. Specifically, there are three principles that I hope to see woven through all our work: Excellence, Equity, and Engagement.</p>
<p>My primary goal as dean is to support our community in the pursuit of excellence. We have the talent, but we need to make sure that faculty, staff, and students have the resources they need to excel in their teaching and scholarly endeavors. Similarly, I want to ensure that our initiatives are driven by a commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion. I’m passionate about making higher education, especially the University of Illinois education, accessible to all students. It is important to have multiple entry points into our programs, on-ramps for career changers, and financial support to offset the cost of higher education. As a group, we should also examine our curricula to ensure there are no barriers to degree completion. I believe technology could play an instrumental role towards these endeavors and I’m pleased that that the College already has multiple initiatives in place that leverage the use of technology to support teaching and learning, making education more broadly accessible.</p>
<p>Finally, consistent with our land-grant mission, it is critical that we elevate our identity as a community-engaged college, mobilizing university knowledge and community experiences to tackle meaningful societal problems.</p>
<p>“I am truly honored to serve the College of Education in this role, building on the outstanding legacy of prior deans. I look forward to working with the talented faculty, staff, alumni, and students to further strengthen the College’s prominence and leadership both nationally and globally.”{ .large .blockquote }</p>
