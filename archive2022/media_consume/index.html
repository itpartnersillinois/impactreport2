        <h1>Colleges of Education and Media Team Up to Help Illinois High Schoolers Understand the Media They Consume</h1>
        <p class="byline"></p>
        <p>When Governor JB Pritzker signed a bill into law on July 9, 2021, requiring that media literacy be taught in public high schools, Illinois became the first state in the nation to mandate such instruction.</p>
<p><img src="/img/leadership/sarah_mccarthey.png" alt="portrait of Sarah McCarthey">{ .top-left }</p>
<p>Immediately after the bill was passed, the College of Education and the College of Media went into action, planning how to prepare Illinois teachers to be ready to instruct students in an area made critical by the massive amount of misinformation that circulates in cyberspace.</p>
<p>The two colleges collaborated to form the Initiative for <strong>Media Education Inquiry and Action (IMEDIA)</strong> to help f ill educators’ needs for media literacy training and curriculum development. The goal of IMEDIA is to assist high school teachers with integrating media analysis and production into their classes and building a robust critical media literacy curriculum in Illinois schools.</p>
<p>IMEDIA launched a pilot program on campus June 27-29, to find out what teachers are already doing in the area of media literacy and to help them integrate a media literacy component into their curriculum, said <strong>Sarah McCarthey</strong>, head of the Department of Curriculum &amp; Instruction.</p>
<p>“Media literacy is especially important in light of the last presidential election and the amount of disinformation and misinformation that is pervasive in the U.S.,” McCarthey said. “It’s more and more critical that we equip students with the ability to discern what’s factual from what’s not.” { .blockquote }</p>
