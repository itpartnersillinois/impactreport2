        <h1>Announcing the Inaugural Cohort of Public Engagement Faculty Fellows</h1>
        <p>Four assistant professors in the College will collaboratively define values and indicators for public  engagement during the 2022-23 academic year.</p>
<p>They will help the College of Education delineate values and definitions for publicly-engaged research,  outline indicators and metrics for publicly-engaged scholars in the tenure process, and engage their communities in ways consistent with the values framework defined by the Committee of Fellows and  Office of Public Engagement staff.</p>
<p>“Public engagement is very much at the center of the College’s mission,” Emily Stone, Director of Public Engagement notes. “It creates a translational research cycle for the College in the sense that through our public engagement efforts, we learn more about what our partners need us to be researching, and through that research, we are able to provide feedback to those partners. It creates a very meaningful academic environment.” { .blockquote }</p>
