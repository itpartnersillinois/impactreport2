<p>Sarah McCarthey has impacted countless numbers of students’ lives through giving—financially and through teaching and service. Her latest gift is a fellowship for talented doctoral students.</p>
<p>“It’s important that we prepare educators to conduct research in the most innovative ways to prepare licensure students to be excellent teachers,” says McCarthey, department head and professor of Curriculum and Instruction in the College of Education. The Sarah McCarthey Doctoral Fellowship that she has established will provide three years of support for an incoming doctoral student to study teacher education.</p>
<p>It’s not the first time McCarthey has helped students financially. She also established, in 2016, an ongoing undergraduate scholarship to help take some of the sting out of the rising cost of tuition.</p>
<p>Additionally, McCarthey and her husband, Mark Dressman, professor emeritus in Curriculum &amp; Instruction, established the McCarthey Dressman Education Foundation in 2000 to serve as a catalyst in maximizing the skills and creativity of educators at the K-12 levels and to cultivate pioneering approaches to teaching that result in dynamic student learning. The foundation pays particular attention to proposals that best serve the at-risk and underfunded.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a real desire to make a difference in the world, to make it a better place, and often where you can make the greatest impact is at the local levels.” —Sarah McCarthey { .blockquote .blockquote-left }</p>
