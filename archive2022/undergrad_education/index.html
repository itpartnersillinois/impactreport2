Our undergraduate programs equip students with the 21st-century knowledge, skills, and sensibilities needed to teach and lead in today’s classrooms and boardrooms. With our focus on diversity, technology, and in-depth field work, students are prepared to professionally engage within complex learning environments.</p>
<h2>Understanding the Whole Child through Community Experience and Service</h2>
<p>The <strong>Identity and Difference in Education course (EDUC 201)</strong> allows students at the University of Illinois to understand children as members of families, communities, and neighborhoods before thinking about them as students in classrooms. Working through that lens, they receive placements at local organizations to volunteer and engage with kids and community members.</p>
<h2>School and Community Experiences</h2>
<p>During the first two years of the pandemic, the College of Education successfully placed 100% of its students that required placements in schools or with community organizations.</p>
<p>“We have twenty-four local school districts that we work with. Each one had their own policy: face-to-face, hybrid, or completely remote.At the beginning of the pandemic, we had to figure out how we were going to navigate that situation.”</p>
<p>— Cara Gutzmer, director of School and Community Experiences</p>
