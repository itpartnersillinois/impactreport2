The second annual **TEACH Academy**, offered through the Center for Education in Small Urban Communities was held on the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus over three days this past July. **Victor Perez** is director of Center for Education in Small Urban Communities and of TEACH Academy.

The power-packed conference offered local educators the opportunity to grow and invest in their—and their students’—future.

University of Illinois Chancellor Robert J. Jones’ letter welcoming this year’s participants noted that the academy, sponsored by the Campus Community Compact to Accelerate Social Justice, “seeks to address systemic racism and social injustice by investing in the lives of our local teachers, children, and communities.” Jones wrote that the newfound knowledge implemented by last year’s participants “resulted in preliminary improvement, especially on Algebra 1 test scores.”

The academy places a heavy emphasis on differentiation with equity and inclusion serving as one of the core tenants of professional development. We are building a community of educators that actively engage in reflective practices that are grounded in research. Teachers benefit from modeling, co-teaching, coaching, and collaborating with other educators and experts,” says Perez.{.quote}

The TEACH Academy addresses the needs of students, particularly those from historically marginalized groups, Perez says. “These students often lack the access and opportunities to learning designed to promote academic success and critical consciousness,” he says.

Over the years, Perez adds, the academy has helped bridge the gap between researcher and practitioner. “It is one of many outreach efforts that help bond the University of Illinois to the local community,” he notes. “There is a strong desire for teachers to access a space where they can reimagine their professional practice and build on their strengths. The TEACH Academy offers a place for educators to grow.”
