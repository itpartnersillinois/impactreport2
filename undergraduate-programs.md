## Andres Cisneros

A special education major, Andres received a **Fulbright English Teaching Assistantship** to teach in the Canary Islands of Spain. Before graduating in May 2024, Andres also studied in Morocco and Italy.

**“Stepping outside my homogeneous neighborhood in Chicago to the University of Illinois was the best decision I have made. I never expected to be able to travel across the world, learn how to communicate better, or carry myself with more confidence. The support I had from all sectors across the College of Education and campus makes me proud to be an Illini!”**
