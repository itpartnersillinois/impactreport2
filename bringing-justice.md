Asif Wilson is leading a team of researchers and educators in equipping K-12 social studies teachers in Illinois to create inquiry-based, justice-centered learning experiences for their students.{.introduction}

In 2022, the Illinois State Board of Education and the University of Illinois launched, under Asif Wilson’s leadership, **I3: Inclusive, Inquiry-Based Social Studies for Illinois**.

The five-year project aims to create and implement professional learning for every K-12 social studies teacher in Illinois.

“We’ve impacted over 500,000 students in 500 schools through a network of 5,000 teachers, 750 of whom have completed our intensive I3 professional learning series,” says Wilson, an assistant professor in Curriculum & Instruction. “We’ve had 50,000 hits on our documents and resources in four months. We have a lot of traction.”

## Creation of the Social Studies Network

I3 became the catalyst for the formation of the Social Studies Network—a vast, statewide virtual meeting place and learning space where research and resources are shared and professional learning experiences are accessed.

“I wanted to build a space for social science educators,” Wilson explains. “I wanted them to have a space to build community and to go for professional learning and access to research and resources.”

That idea, he says, has come to fruition. And in doing so, it is increasing the University of Illinois’ reach.

“The resources that we’re developing and the research that we’re creating and leading and being a part of and the professional learning we’re developing and leading will reach more and more teachers and students across the state of Illinois,” Wilson says.

“In three years, the Social Studies Network has done 10 to 20 years of work, and I’m really excited about all that’s coming in the future.”

We believe that all students deserve inquiry-based and justice-centered learning experiences and want to support teachers in creating those contexts of exploration and action,” Wilson says.{.quote}

## The Social Studies Network is Home to Three Initiatives

**I3: Inclusive, Inquiry-Based Social Studies for Illinois** was born from legislation that called for the creation of an Inclusive American History Commission.

**Teaching Civics for Justice Illinois** offers a five-part asynchronous learning experience. The initiative is a partnership between the Social Studies Network and the Illinois Department of Human Services.

**Communiversities** was first launched in Chicago in the 1960s and consisted of high school students, community activists, scholars, teachers, and professors through the Black Congress. Wilson received a Chancellor’s Call to Action grant to build out the second iteration with with Black families and teachers to study resistance to school closures in Chicago over the past 20 years.
