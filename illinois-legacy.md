Sophomore Sophie Kamienski is the third generation to attend Illinois and study special education. She is joining her mother and grandmother as Illinois educators.{.introduction}

When **Sophie Kamienski** was in her first-year orientation, she was asked to take a survey. One of the questions was, “What made you choose the College of Education?” There was one excellent reason. She wrote, “Because both my mother and grandmother became teachers through the College of Education.”

Being a third-generation Illinois graduate was an opportunity too good to pass up. Now Sophie is following in the footsteps of her mother, **Kara Kamienski**, ‘01 SPED, and grandmother, **Cathy Jo Stratman**, Ed.M. ‘99 SPED.

When Kara attended the University of Illinois, she immediately got involved, spending much of her free time working with registered student organizations. “I was a part of the Student Ambassadors/Student Alumni Association,” says Kara, “I was able to meet the most incredible student leaders who taught me so much about myself. I was also part of the Greek system and loved the sisterhood.”

“I learned an incredible amount in the classroom at Illinois, but what I learned outside of the classroom mattered even more,” she says.

Meanwhile, Cathy Jo—in the midst of her 34-year career in special education at the Decatur Public School Coop— attended Illinois at the same time as her daughter. She was a student in a new program that allowed current teachers to take classes at night to get their Master’s in Special Education. Even though she was taking night classes, she still got the Illinois Experience.

“Although the U. of I. seemed like such a huge school, we had our own group and thrived in that environment,” says Cathy Jo. “I loved attending football and basketball games and watching the band. I also loved walking around the campus, especially the quad, and feeling a part of the spirit and tradition of Illinois.”

When asked how it feels to be a third-generation Education student, Sophie says she’s thankful for the opportunity.

“Following in their footsteps and reaching for a rewarding career helping people I am passionate about is very close to my heart. I want to work every day in my studies to live up to the standards of being the best teacher I can be,” she says.
