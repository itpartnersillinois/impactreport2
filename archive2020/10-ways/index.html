<p><em class="tenways">2</em> Illinois leads the <strong>Office of Community College Research and Leadership</strong>, a program that supports and assists community colleges across the state.</p>
<p><em class="tenways">3</em> The Illinois <strong>Early Learning Project</strong> offers online information and resources that improve school readiness. Resources like lists of benchmarks by age, tip sheets, project suggestions, instructional videos and examples of learning and development standards are available to families, childcare providers, teachers and early childhood professionals across the state.</p>
<p><em class="tenways">4</em> The Illinois <strong>Early Intervention Clearinghouse (EIC)</strong> is a free, state-funded lending library that identifies and collects research-based and best-practice early intervention and early childhood information, including resources useful for caregivers of children with special needs.</p>
<p><em class="tenways">5</em> The Illinois <strong>New Teacher Collaborative (INTC)</strong> provides free and low-cost services to assist districts and induction programs across Illinois.</p>
<p><em class="tenways">6</em> The Illinois <strong>Children and Family Research Center (CFRC)</strong> monitors the safety and well-being of children and families who are involved with the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services due to abuse or neglect and reports their findings to the Governor, the legislature and the public.</p>
<p><em class="tenways">7</em> The Illinois <strong>Early Intervention Training Program (EITP)</strong> provides professional development opportunities for all early intervention professionals in Illinois, and is funded by the Illinois Department of Human Services Bureau.</p>
<p><em class="tenways">8</em> Illinois houses the <strong>National Institute for Learning Outcomes Assessment (NILOA)</strong>, a research and resource-development organization dedicated to documenting, advocating, and facilitating the systematic use of learning outcomes assessment to improve student learning.
