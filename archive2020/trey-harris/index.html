            <h2>Middle Grades Education major</h2>
<p><a href="https://storied.illinois.edu/qa-with-trey-harris-edu-21/">Trey Harris</a> is a Golden Apple Scholar who is passionate about the world of education and teaching. Golden Apple prepares (and helps support through tuition assistance) high school seniors and first- and second-year Illinois college students who have the determination and drive to be excellent teachers.</p>
<p>He worked in Chicago Public Schools with their summer school programs, helping students who struggled during the school year to move forward into the next grade.</p>
<p class="blockquote-small">&quot;This was such an eye-opening experience for me, seeing the many students that Chicago Public Schools serve. I enjoyed being a positive role model to look up to, and I hope they could see themselves doing some of the things I do. I want to be that mentor that shows them that it isnâ€™t always about where you start, but how you finish.&quot;</p>
