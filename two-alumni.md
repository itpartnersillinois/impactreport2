The Golden Apple Foundation, the leading Illinois-based nonprofit committed to preparing, mentoring, and honoring great educators who advance educational opportunities for students, recognized **Alicia Carlisle** ‘11 C&I, a first grade teacher at Turner Drew Language Academy in Chicago, and **Joseph Cella**, ‘10 C&I, a Pre-K teacher at GEMS World Academy in Chicago, with the prestigious annual award.

Carlisle and Cella are two of 10 Illinois teachers awarded in 2024. Following a highly competitive process, they were selected from more than 600 nominations of Pre-K to third grade teachers.

“These exceptional educators have demonstrated an unwavering commitment, innovative spirit, and transformative influence on their students and school communities,” said Alan Mather, president of The Golden Apple Foundation. “They are not merely outstanding instructors but impactful leaders as well. By joining our mission, the 2024 award recipients will help shape the future of teaching, empowering the next generation of talented educators to make a profound difference in even more young lives.”

The Golden Apple Awards for Excellence in Teaching honor outstanding teachers for having lasting, positive effects on students’ lives and school communities. Teacher recipients demonstrate – in their teaching and results – significant, positive impact on their students’ growth and learning.

Each award recipient receives a $5,000 cash award and a spring sabbatical provided by Northwestern University at no cost. Award recipients also become Fellows of the Golden Apple Academy of Educators, a community of educators who play an important role in preparing the next generation of teachers in the Golden Apple Scholars and Accelerators programs – which are dedicated to addressing the teacher shortage in Illinois.
