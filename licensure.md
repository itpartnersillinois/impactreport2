In August 2023, Illinois passed legislation requiring teacher institutes to provide instruction on **trauma-informed practices** for in-service and preservice teachers. The College of Education was ahead of curve, already preparing **two new online programs** centered on trauma-informed practices: one a master’s program, the other a graduate certificate.

**Lynn Burdick**, director of trauma-informed education in Curriculum & Instruction, and **Catherine Corr**, associate professor in Special Education, have been instrumental in getting those programs out—and in helping to shape the future of trauma-informed education throughout Illinois.

Burdick and Corr served on a committee that was charged last year by the **Illinois State Board of Education** to come up with initial and renewal licensure recommendations.

Our committee made recommendations based on ISBE’s goals, including  demonstrated proficiency in adverse childhood experiences, trauma, secondary traumatic stress, and creating trauma-responsive learning environments,” says Burdick.{.quote}

Research shows that teachers who use trauma-informed practices experience reduced classroom management challenges and higher student achievement. And, Corr says, it helps to retain teachers.
