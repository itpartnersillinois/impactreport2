## Marlee Bunch

Marlee, who recently earned her Ed.D. online in Diversity & Equity in Education, is creating frameworks for culturally responsive classrooms. Her new book, due out in October 2024, is called **The Magnitude of Us: An Educator’s Guide to Creating Culturally Responsive Classrooms** (Teachers College Press).

**“I wanted to address the gap that exists for educators regarding implementing culturally responsive teaching practices. For too long, we have seen a gap in research and knowledge regarding the stories, voices, and histories of silenced or overlooked cultures and communities.”**
