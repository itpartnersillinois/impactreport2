## CREAâ€™S Mission

**The mission of the Center for Culturally Responsive Evaluation and Assessment** is to generate evidence for policymaking that is not only methodologically but also culturally and contextually defensible. CREA is an international community of scholars/practitioners that exists to promote a culturally responsive stance in all forms of systematic inquiry including evaluation, assessment, policy analysis, applied research and action research.
