## Huong Thi Dieu Nguyen

Huong completed her bachelor’s degree in her home country, Vietnam. She was awarded a prestigious Fulbright Scholarship to further her studies, and in 2017 **co-founded the “Brave Girls” Project**, funded by the U.S. State Department and designed to empower women and girls through leadership development, critical thinking, and civic engagement. Huong also coordinates the **Viet-Skype Project**, promoting conversational English practice for Vietnamese students and connecting them with native English speakers across the world. She graduated with her M.S. in Curriculum & Instruction and was named an Outstanding Student Medal recipient in 2024.
