The question is not whether racism in our schools exists, but what we are going to do about it. The first step, says **Osly J. Flores**, an assistant professor in Education Policy, Organization & Leadership, is for education leaders to develop a race-conscious ethic.

People who have a race-conscious, caring ethic see their responsibility in recognizing the historical significance and impact of race, and the asset that comes with that. It’s not just deficit thinking about communities of color.”{.quote}

Flores is coauthoring a book on race-conscious caring and ethics due out in 2025.
