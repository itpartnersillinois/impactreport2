**Gabriella Potocki** graduated from the University of Illinois in May 2024 with a degree in Learning & Education Studies. She began her career weeks later as part of Caterpillar’s learning and development team where she develops leadership training programs for Caterpillar’s IT staff.

When she began her undergraduate studies in the College of Education, Potocki planned on becoming a special education teacher, but around her junior year she embarked on a different path.

I found that my teaching skills better aligned with adult learning theory, and the College actually gave me those opportunities to be able to teach in the adult world,” says Potocki.{.quote}

In September, she returned to campus for Homecoming knowing the benefits of maintaining ties with her Alma Mater.

“It was great to reconnect with other alumni and my College of Education peers while strengthening the connections that have helped me on my career path,” says Potocki. “The university’s alumni network is an amazing support system in terms of professional growth and advancement.”
